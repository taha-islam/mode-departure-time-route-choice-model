Welcome to METRO
================

METRO model was implemented entirely in Python 2 Programming Language (Python Software Foundation ), with the single exception of the traffic assignment and transit assignment, which run in Aimsun. METRO was implemented not only to be integrated with the proposed time-based transit fare optimization platform, which is the main focus of this thesis, but also to be a generic comprehensive transportation model that can be easily extended to cover more aspects and suit other TDM strategies. This appendix presents a brief description of the Python package of the METRO model. Figure C-1 shows the structure of the metro package and its modules and submodules, all of which are described in the following sections.
